Whats TinyJSEditor?
-------------------
TinyJSEditor is a modern Editor. It's based on jQuery.

The WYSIWYG Editor doesn't work!

Aw, crap. Maybe your Browser doesn't support the HTML5 Attribute "contenteditable".

Diffrents between Quellcode Editor and WYSIWYG Editor?
------------------------------------------------------
In Quellcode Editor you can see all Code you've written. In "normal" Editor see the result from the code (HTML / BB Code).
